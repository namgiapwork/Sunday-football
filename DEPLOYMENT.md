# Deployment and service configuration

The code, schema and seed are all in this repository. What is **not** in it is the
configuration applied to Supabase and Vercel through their dashboards and APIs.
Without the steps below a fresh deployment builds and runs, but password reset
links break and the site sits behind a Vercel login wall.

This is the checklist for standing the app up somewhere new, or for handing it to
somebody else.

## 1. Supabase project

Create a project, then fill in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`) and apply the
schema:

```bash
npm run setup           # writes the two API keys into .env.local
npm run setup:supabase  # stores an account token for migrations
npm run db:apply        # applies every migration, tracked in schema_migrations
npm run db:seed         # development data only — never in production
```

`npm run db:apply -- --status` lists what has been applied and what is pending.
For a database created by hand, `npm run db:apply -- --baseline <version>` records
migrations up to that version as applied without re-running them.

### Auth settings

These are **not** in the repository and must be set per project, under
Authentication → URL Configuration and Providers → Email:

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site URL | the production URL | Where emailed links come back to |
| Redirect URLs | `https://<production>/**` and `http://localhost:3000/**` | Otherwise a reset link is rejected |
| Minimum password length | 8 | Matches what the form asks for |

They can also be set through the Management API:

```
PATCH https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/<ref>/config/auth
{ "site_url": "...", "uri_allow_list": "...", "password_min_length": 8 }
```

### A known limitation

Free-tier projects use a shared email sender and cannot customise email
templates. The recovery link therefore arrives in Supabase's default format,
which delivers its credential in the URL fragment — handled in
`app/(auth)/admin-reset/`.

That sender is also unreliable: mail providers pre-open links to scan them, which
burns the one-time token before the organiser clicks it, producing
`otp_expired`. `npm run admin:password` is the way back in when that happens.
Configuring a custom SMTP sender removes the problem.

## 2. Vercel project

```bash
npm run setup:vercel    # stores a deploy token
npx vercel link --yes --project <name>
```

Push these environment variables to **production and preview** — the
`NEXT_PUBLIC_` ones are inlined at build time, so they must exist before a build,
not just at runtime:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

`DATABASE_URL` and the `*-token` files are local tooling only. They must never be
added to Vercel.

### Turn off Deployment Protection

Vercel enables **Vercel Authentication** on new projects, which redirects
anonymous visitors to a Vercel login. For an app the whole group opens from a
chat link, this has to go:

Project → Settings → Deployment Protection → Vercel Authentication → Disabled.

Or:

```
PATCH https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/<id>
{ "ssoProtection": null }
```

Verify with a request that carries no cookies, not just in a browser you are
already signed into Vercel with:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<production>/
```

A `307` to `vercel.com/login` means it is still protected.

## 3. The first organiser

Admins sign in with Supabase Auth rather than a PIN.

1. Authentication → Users → **Add user**, with an email and password, and
   **Auto Confirm User** ticked.
2. Make sure a player row carries the same email — the `on_auth_user_created`
   trigger links the two automatically:

```sql
update players set email = 'you@example.com' where name = 'Your Name';
update group_members set role = 'admin'
 where player_id = (select id from players where name = 'Your Name');
```

Then sign in at `/admin-login`.

## 4. Group settings

Kickoff times, venue and the reveal schedule are **data**, not configuration, and
are edited in the app under Admin → Settings. A new deployment starts from the
values in `supabase/seed.sql`.

## Handing this over

Someone taking this on needs:

- this repository
- **Supabase**: an invitation to the project (Settings → Team), not the keys
- **Vercel**: an invitation to the project, not the token
- the production URL

Never send API keys or tokens in a message. Adding somebody to both projects lets
them generate their own, and lets you remove their access later.
